# Installing Wine and Microsoft Office

This installation will take place on Ubuntu 18 with a 64 bit computer.

First, follow [this](https://wiki.winehq.org/Ubuntu) instructions.

Download and make executable, winetricks, like instructed [here](https://wiki.winehq.org/Winetricks#Installing_winetricks).

Then, following the tricks mentioned [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/252372/installation-problem-ms-office-2013-using-wine).

Close, but no cigar. Tried with MO 2016 and 2013, with Windows 7 enabled, but it didn't work.
